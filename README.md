# REF1356-Datel-Sharkwire
Everything necessary to produce the N64 Sharkwire by Datel

This repository is the culmination of a joint effort between myself, [Jhynjhiruu](https://github.com/Jhynjhiruu), and [PPCASM](https://github.com/ppcasm). Without all of us, this wouldn't be here today. This PCB has been fully evaluated and is a complete replica of the original.

This repository now enables anyone with the necessary pcb assembly skills to fabricate an N64 Sharkwire. Some components must be harvested from an N64 Gameshark or Gameshark Pro. You are on your own to acquire the modem chipset, U11, and U13. They are COTS ICs, but seemingly hard to find. If you can find datasheets for U11 and U13, please share them with us!

Happy making!

PCB Thickness: 1.2 mm
